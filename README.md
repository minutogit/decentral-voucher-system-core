# Decentralized Voucher System - Core Library

*(Work in Progress)*

## Overview

This repository contains the core library providing the foundational logic, data structures, and functionalities for the [Decentralized Voucher Payment System](https://github.com/minutogit/decentralized-voucher-payment-system).

It is intended to be used as a dependency by the main application and potentially other tools within the ecosystem.

## Running Playgrounds (Examples)

To quickly experiment with the library's components and see example outputs in your terminal, you can run the included examples (playgrounds). This is useful for understanding the current state and capabilities of the library during development.

Examples are typically located in the `examples/` directory of a Rust project.

**Steps:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/minutogit/voucher_lib.git
    cd voucher_lib
    ```
2.  **Run an example using Cargo:**
    Cargo, the Rust build tool and package manager, will handle compiling the library and the specific example code.

    To run the `playground_utils` example:
    ```bash
    cargo run --example playground_utils
    ```

    To run the `playground_crypto_utils` example:
    ```bash
    cargo run --example playground_crypto_utils
    ```

    Cargo will automatically download dependencies, compile the necessary code, and execute the chosen example file (e.g., `examples/playground_utils.rs`). The output will be printed directly to your console.
